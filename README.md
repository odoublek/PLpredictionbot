**This project is not finished, its still on development.

This project aims to predict the outcome of the Premier League matches. First i use an api to retrieve necessary information about teams (their history, goals scored and so on) and than i put all the desired data on dataframes using Pandas. After that i created an algorithm using linear regression model to predict the outcome. For predicting, my algorithm uses the team history data and get the percentage of the winner team. I'm still working on machine learning part to make predictions more accurate.
